This C# project is a comprehensive personal organizer application developed for the Object Oriented Programming II course. The application features:

- User Management: Admin and normal user roles, with functionalities to register and login. The first registered user is an admin and the ones after that are users.
- Phone Book: Detailed contact management with options to list, create, update, and delete records.
- Notes: Simple note-taking functionality with the ability to list, create, update, and delete notes.
- Personal Information: User profile management with fields for personal details, password changes, and profile photo (stored as base64 in CSV). Whilst admins can update every user, normal users can only edit themselves. The admins can assign users as admins.
- Calculates minimum salary based on specific parameters published by the Chamber of Computer Engineers (BMO), with adjustments for part-time users.
- Reminder System: Manages reminders (meetings and tasks) with notifications and an alarm system.

Each module stores data in a separate CSV file. Admins can download the CSV files in order to view the full extent of them.
